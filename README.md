<h2>🔍 Contracts Detail</h2>
<br>


<h3>💰 ICOToken.sol</h3>
<br>
<p><strong>Simple Erc20 Token where we are going to override some functions.</strong></p>
<p><strong>To use this contract, we must to pass only one parameter and it's totalSupply for our new Token.</strong></p>

<br>
<h3>Functions to start with are:</h3>
<br>

<br>

<p><strong>We can buy some tokens with this function.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Amount can't exceed total supply and should be > 0.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Price per token is 0.001 ether, so if we are going to buy 100 we will pay 0.1 ether.</strong></p>
